    "short_hook": "Learn why Golden Retrievers develop separation anxiety and follow a clear, step-by-step plan to help your dog stay calm when you leave the house.",
    "context": "Goldens are people-pleasers and shadow dogs, which makes them lovable – and also prone to separation anxiety if you don’t train independence early.",
    "who_struggles_with_this": "Owners of this breed often face this issue due to natural instincts."

    {
      "question": "Will my Golden Retriever grow out of separation anxiety?",
      "answer": "Some mild anxiety improves with age and routine, but true separation anxiety usually needs training. Waiting and hoping often makes the pattern deeper and harder to change."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is getting a second dog the solution?",
      "answer": "A second dog adds more energy, cost and training needs. If your Golden is attached to you, not just lonely, another dog may not fix the core issue – and you now have two untrained dogs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do calming treats or CBD help with separation anxiety?",
      "answer": "Good calming products can take the edge off and make training easier, but they’re not magic. Think of them as support for a solid training plan, not the entire solution."

    "at_home_strategies": [
      "Step 1: Rule Out Medical and Overarousal Issues: Before assuming it’s purely separation anxiety, rule out pain, urinary issues and extreme under-exercise. A young, under-exercised Golden with zero mental stimulation will melt down even with light alone time.",
      "Step 2: Create a Safe 'Alone Zone': Set up a gated area or crate with a bed, chew toys and a food puzzle. Feed most meals here so your dog associates this space with safety and good things.",
      "Step 3: Train Micro-Separations Every Day: Start with 10–30 seconds of going out of sight and returning calmly before your dog gets worked up. Slowly increase to 1, 2, 5, 10 minutes over days and weeks – always below the panic threshold.",
      "Step 4: De-Big Deal Your Departures and Arrivals: Avoid long emotional goodbyes and wild reunions. Put on your shoes, pick up keys, walk out and come back like it’s no big deal. Your dog learns from your energy.",
      "Step 5: Add Calming Support and Structured Enrichment: Give a long-lasting chew or stuffed Kong only when you leave. For some Goldens, vetted calming supplements or CBD products can take the edge off while you work on training.",
      "Step 6: Get Professional Help If Panic Is Severe: If your Golden injures themselves, breaks crates or is drenched in drool when you return, you need a trainer or veterinary behaviorist. Severe cases rarely fix themselves."
    ],
    "when_to_consider_trainer": "If your Golden is breaking teeth or nails trying to escape, losing weight, or you’re getting complaints from neighbors, it’s time to get professional help.",
    "when_to_talk_to_vet": "If behavior changes suddenly or is severe."

  "realistic_expectations": {
    "timeline": "Varies by dog, typically weeks to months.",
    "what_success_looks_like": "Most adult Golden Retrievers can eventually learn to stay alone for 4–6 hours at a time, but you can’t jump from 'never alone' to '6 hours alone' overnight."
