      "question": "Is a Golden Retriever an expensive dog to own in Austin?",
      "answer": "Yes. Golden Retrievers are large, active dogs with higher food needs and a real risk of joint and cancer expenses. Plan on $140–$270 per month in Austin, plus a solid emergency fund or insurance."

    {
      "question": "Do I really need pet insurance for a Golden Retriever?",
