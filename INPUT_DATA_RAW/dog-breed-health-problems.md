- **Genetic Load**: Some breeds (particularly Cavalier King Charles Spaniels) carry 6-13% more deleterious genetic alleles than other breeds
- **Most Common Genetic Disorders**: Elbow dysplasia and dilated cardiomyopathy appear more frequently in purebred dogs; cruciate ligament rupture more common in mixed breeds
- **Hip Dysplasia Prevalence**: Hip dysplasia affects numerous large breeds and some small breeds like French Bulldogs
- **Insurance Claims**: Different breeds show varying patterns in insurance claim rates for specific conditions

---

## Breed-Specific Testing Available

Many breeds benefit from genetic testing to identify carriers:

## Notes for Consumers

1. **Responsible Breeding**: Ask breeders for health testing results on parents
2. **Pet Insurance**: Highly recommended for purebred dogs; average cancer treatment costs $4,100
3. **Preventative Care**: Regular vet check-ups, weight management, appropriate exercise
4. **Early Detection**: Many conditions benefit from early diagnosis and management
5. **Ethical Considerations**: PETA and other organizations argue that selective breeding for physical traits (especially in brachycephalic breeds) has created inherent health problems
6. **Lifespan Impact**: Some health issues can reduce life expectancy by 2-4 years
