## PART 13: MONEY-SAVING TIPS BY REGION

### Strategies to Reduce Costs

**In Expensive States/Cities (CA, NY, MA)**:
1. Adopt instead of purchase (saves $2,000–$3,000+)
2. Use pet insurance (prevents $5,000+ emergency costs)
3. Groom at home (save $600–$1,200/year)
4. Join group training classes ($15–$30/class vs. $60–$100 private)
5. Buy food in bulk online
6. Use community vet clinics (lower cost services)
7. Consider neighboring, less expensive areas (30 min drive can save $500–$1,000/year)

**In Affordable States (ID, OK, ND)**:
1. Adopt from shelters ($50–$200)
2. Skip insurance (lower vet costs don't justify premium)
3. Professional grooming less critical
4. Local breeders very affordable
